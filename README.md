## JackPine - A Geospatial Benchmark (Version 3.0)

A modified code to match current databases versions.

Changes:
```
- Manage dependencies and build code with gradle.
- Changed Dialects and tables to support new data and tools.
- Introduced PolyphenyDB support.
```

To Do:
```
- Remove or update queries for data that are not available publicly.
- Add more data support.
```

Dataset
-------
Dataset is described well in the original papers. 
Furthermore, it could be downloaded from the links below:

How to run
----------
To run a single benchmark scenario called `ReadSpatialAreaContainsArea` over the Postgres:
```shell
./gradlew run --args="-include connection_postgresql_spatial.properties -props config/ReadSpatialAreaContainsArea.properties -html results/output.html"
```

To run all scenarios:
```shell
./jackpine.sh -i "connection_postgresql_spatial.properties"
```
